//Prompt
Explain to me, as if I have no knowledge and very little technical background, what encapsulation is in OOP in less than 5 sentences.

//Response
Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling data and functions into a single unit called a class. This allows the class to control access to its data, so that only the functions defined within the class can manipulate it. Encapsulation helps to keep code organized and secure, preventing unintended changes or errors caused by external code.

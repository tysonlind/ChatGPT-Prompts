prompt:
what is a class in programming?

response:
In programming, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects that define the properties and behavior of those objects. It is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) and is used to create reusable code and organize data into meaningful structures.

A class contains data members (also called fields or attributes) and member functions (also called methods or operations). The data members define the state of the object, while the member functions define its behavior.

When you create an instance of a class, you create an object that has the same properties and behavior as defined in the class. You can then access and modify the data members and call the member functions of the object.

Classes provide a way to create complex, modular programs by breaking down a system into smaller, more manageable pieces. They also enable code reuse, as you can create multiple objects from the same class definition.
